# The-Pig-Game

The-Pig-game is a very simple *dice* game in which two players play according to their enabled rounds to reach 100 points. At each round, a player will  repeatedly roll a die till either a 1 is rolled or the player clicks the hold button and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the round total). At every time whilst the player rolls the die, the player has to make one of two decisions:

A) *ROLL*- If the player rolls a
1: the player has no scores (i.e every score previously gained will be lost) and it moves onto the opponent's turn
2 - 6: the number is then added to the player's round total and the player's turn continues.

B) *HOLD*- The round total is then added to the player's score and it then becomes the opponent's turn.


## To win:
Any of the players that gets to 100 first wins the game.
